<p>Established in 1952, Paul Bunyan restaurants have been serving the Coeur d'Alene community with great milkshakes, burgers, homemade onion rings and fries! Bob Ovnicek in his teenage years worked for Paul Bunyan in CDA and later went on to purchase it in 1981 from Gary Ormesher. Gary Ormesher was the son of the original owners Louis and Mildred Ormesher, fun fact Paul Bunyan's original name was Louie's in and out but the 30 foot Paul Bunyan standing tall on north west boulevard that use to be old Hwy 10 has always been the mascot! As Bob's family grew so did the business, his son Scott Ovnicek opened up Hayden Paul Bunyan in 1992 to keep the tradition going, after he graduated from Boise state with a masters degree in business. Scott then moved on to opening the Post Falls Paul Bunyan in 1994 and then Rathdrum location in 2014.</p>
<p>Today Scott and Bob both oversee the restaurants yet they are still very involved! Some of the things they do is get supplies, bookwork, maintenance and much more. The four restaurants each have a managere of their own. Cda's location's manager is Carla and she has been the manager for over 20 years and employed there for 30, I think she is family now. The Post Falls manager has been there for over 10 years and the Rathdrum's manager Carter is following in his fathers, Scott Ovnicek's, foot steps by gooing to school to get a degree in business.</p>
<p>The Ovnicek family will maintain their hands on approach for running their business. With doing their own payroll, making their own menus and hand delivering supplies this will keep them very involved and very busy! This is shown throughout the business with things like their murals painted by Bobs wife Sharon and homemade onion rings.</p>
